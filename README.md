## How It's Made:

This is a full stack message board that allows you to enter a book into the library catalog. The status and condition can be edited once a book is entered.


## Lessons Learned:
This project was challenging because I was working with various <select> elements and passing the value selected to the back end and again to the front end. I learned how to iterate over the <option> on a <select> element and add event listeners to each.
